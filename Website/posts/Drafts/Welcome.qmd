Welcome to Holy Grail Ratings. This is a project of mine to try and model AFL margins as best as possible. There's a long roadmap for this project which I'll discuss at the end of the post. But for now I think its best to explain how the model currently works and why I've made particular choices, and how to interpret the dashboards on the homepage.

Welcome to Holy Grail Ratings!
